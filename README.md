# ClampFi Protocol

## The First Supply-Clamping Meme Token Launchpad

ClampFi is an innovative meme token launchpad built on Core blockchain that introduces revolutionary supply clamping technology to make rug pulls mathematically impossible while preserving the fun and creativity of meme tokens.

## üîí What is Supply Clamping?

Supply clamping is a breakthrough security approach that limits token holders' ability to dump large amounts of tokens at once by implementing:

1. **Time-Based Locking**: Tokens are locked for specific time periods
2. **Graduated Release**: Vested tokens unlock gradually, not all at once
3. **Maximum Daily Limits**: Holders can only sell a percentage of their holdings per day
4. **Dynamic Adjustments**: Sell limits adapt based on market conditions

## üõ°Ô∏è Key Security Features

### Anti-Rug Pull Mechanics

- Mandatory creator token locking (minimum 30 days)
- Required liquidity locking (minimum 180 days)
- Maximum sell limits of 3% per wallet per day
- Bonding curve option that makes liquidity rug pulls impossible

### Stability Mechanisms

- Price stability through automatic mint/burn functions
- Configurable price thresholds for intervention
- Market stress detection for additional protection
- Bonding curve option for algorithmic price stability

### Community Governance

- On-chain governance through token-weighted voting
- Community control of platform parameters
- Democratic proposal and execution system
- Transparent, immutable rules

## üìä How It Works

### Token Creation

Creating tokens through ClampFi requires:

- Creator token locking (minimum 20% of supply)
- Liquidity provision with time lock
- Compliance with minimum security standards

### Token Trading

ClampFi offers two trading models:

1. **Traditional DEX Trading** - With enhanced security layers
2. **Bonding Curve** - Algorithmic pricing that prevents rug pulls

### Supply Locks

Tokens are subject to:

- Time-based release schedules
- Maximum daily selling limits
- Vesting options for gradual distribution
- Transparent on-chain lock tracking

### Governance

Platform parameters are controlled by:

- Token-weighted voting by the community
- Formal proposal process
- Transparent execution of approved changes
- Role-based access control

## üîß Developer Resources

### Smart Contract Architecture

The protocol consists of four main contracts:

1. `Clampify.sol` - Core protocol handling token creation and security
2. `ClampifyToken.sol` - Token implementation with special security features
3. `ClampifyGovernance.sol` - On-chain governance system
4. `BondingCurve.sol` - Algorithmic price discovery implementation

### Key Functions

#### Token Creation

```solidity
function createMemeToken(
    string memory _name,
    string memory _symbol,
    uint256 _totalSupply,
    uint256 _creatorLockPercentage,
    uint256 _creatorLockDuration,
    uint256 _initialLiquidityAmount,
    uint256 _initialPrice,
    bool _enableStability,
    bool _useBondingCurve
) external payable returns (address);
```

#### Supply Locking

```solidity
function lockSupply(
    address _token,
    address _holder,
    uint256 _amount,
    uint256 _releaseTime,
    bool _isVesting,
    uint256 _vestingStart,
    uint256 _vestingDuration
) external;
```

#### Trading via Bonding Curve

```solidity
function buyFromBondingCurve(address _token, uint256 _platformAmount)
    external returns (uint256 _returnAmount);

function sellToBondingCurve(address _token, uint256 _tokenAmount)
    external returns (uint256 _returnAmount);
```

#### Governance Actions

```solidity
function createProposal(
    string memory _description,
    address _targetContract,
    bytes memory _callData,
    uint256 _votingPeriod
) external;
```

## Initial Setup Instructions

After deployment, follow these steps to set up the protocol:

1. Connect Governance to Clampify:

   ```
   # Call from your address to Clampify Contract
   setGovernanceContract(0x14b1c5415C1164fB09450c9e46a00D5C39e52644)
   ```

2. Approve Platform Token for Clampify:

   ```
   # Call from your address to Platform Token Contract
   approve(0x86E47CBf56d01C842AC036A56C8ea2fE0168a2D1, [large amount])
   ```

3. Update DEX Router:

   ```
   # Call from your address to Clampify Contract
   updateDexRouter(0x6c31acd41ff0d0cc33a243eafbc5b22de10733ad)
   ```

4. Set Platform Parameters:
   ```
   # Call from your address to Clampify Contract
   setPlatformFee(200)  # 2% fee
   setTradingFee(50)    # 0.5% fee
   ```
